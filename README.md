### Python Chatbot

This repository contains a Python-based chatbot that leverages natural language processing (NLP) to interact with users in a conversational manner. Developed as part of the CodeAlpha Internship, this project demonstrates how to build a simple chatbot using Python and popular NLP libraries.

## Features

- **Natural Language Understanding:** The chatbot uses NLP techniques to understand and respond to user inputs.
- **Predefined Responses:** The chatbot is equipped with a set of predefined responses based on keywords and patterns.
- **Extensible Design:** The bot can be easily extended with additional responses, intents, or more complex NLP models.
- **Interactive Conversations:** Supports basic conversational flows, allowing the bot to ask questions and respond to user inputs dynamically.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **NLTK or spaCy:** Used for natural language processing tasks such as tokenization, parsing, and keyword matching.
- **Regex:** For pattern matching to identify intents and trigger responses.
- **JSON:** For storing and managing the botâ€™s responses and conversation flow.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries: `nltk`, `spacy`, `re`, etc.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-chatbot.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd python-chatbot
    ```
3. Install the required Python libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. (Optional) Download additional NLP data if using NLTK:
    ```python
    import nltk
    nltk.download('popular')
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the chatbot script:
    ```bash
    python chatbot.py
    ```
2. Start a conversation with the chatbot by typing your messages into the console.
3. The chatbot will respond based on its predefined rules and patterns.

## Customization

- **Adding Responses:** You can modify the chatbot's responses by editing the `responses.json` file or the relevant section in the script.
- **Extending NLP Capabilities:** To improve understanding, you can integrate more advanced NLP models or libraries, such as `spaCy` for entity recognition or sentiment analysis.
- **Improving Conversations:** Enhance the conversational flow by adding more complex dialog management, context tracking, or multi-turn conversation capabilities.

## Example Conversation

```
User: Hi there!
Bot: Hello! How can I assist you today?
User: Tell me a joke.
Bot: Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything!
User: Haha, that's funny.
Bot: I'm glad you liked it! Anything else you'd like to know?
```
